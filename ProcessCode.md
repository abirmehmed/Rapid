**Backend Setup with Flask:**
1. Install Flask using the command `pip install flask`.
2. Create a new Flask application file, e.g., `app.py`.
3. Import the necessary modules and libraries, such as `flask`, `requests`, and `json`.
4. Set up Flask routes to handle incoming requests and responses.
5. Implement the necessary logic to interact with the Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API and Play Store API.

**Frontend Integration with React.js:**
1. Install React.js using the command `npx create-react-app my-app`.
2. Create a new React component file, e.g., `SentimentAnalysis.js`.
3. Import the necessary modules and libraries, such as `react`, `axios`, and `react-chartjs-2`.
4. Set up the necessary state variables and functions to handle user input and API requests.
5. Implement the necessary logic to send requests to the Flask backend and receive responses.

**Sentiment Analysis Logic:**
1. Use the Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API to analyze the sentiment of the given text.
2. Make API requests to the Play Store API to fetch reviews or comments for analysis.
3. Process the received data and extract the necessary information for sentiment analysis.
4. Calculate the sentiment scores and categorize them into positive, negative, or neutral.

**Visualization with EChart:**
1. Install EChart using the command `npm install echarts`.
2. Create a new EChart component file, e.g., `SentimentChart.js`.
3. Import the necessary modules and libraries, such as `echarts` and `react-echarts`.
4. Set up the necessary state variables and functions to handle data visualization.
5. Implement the necessary logic to display the sentiment analysis results using EChart.

**Connecting Frontend and Backend with RESTful APIs:**
1. Define the necessary API endpoints in the Flask backend to handle incoming requests.
2. Implement the logic to process the requests and return the appropriate responses.
3. Use Axios or Fetch API in the React frontend to send requests to the Flask backend.

**Testing and Deployment:**
1. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.
2. Deploy the Flask backend and React frontend to a hosting platform of your choice.
3. Configure the necessary environment variables and settings for production deployment.
