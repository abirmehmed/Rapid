Here is a step-by-step algorithm-style process for completing the Rapid Analyzer project:

1. **Project Planning and Design**
   - Define project goals, objectives, and requirements.
   - Determine the data source for collecting user reviews from the Play Store.
   - Design the user interface for the web application, including the dashboard and visualization components.
   - Plan the integration of AI and analytics tools like Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API, Amplitude, Interceptd, Mixpanel, and UXCam.

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Choose an appropriate method to collect user reviews from the Play Store, such as using the Play Store API or web scraping techniques.
   - Preprocess the collected data by cleaning and formatting it for analysis.
   - Perform any necessary data transformations or feature engineering to prepare the data for sentiment analysis.

3. **Backend and Frontend Development**
   - Set up the backend using Flask, a Python web framework.
   - Create RESTful APIs to handle data retrieval and processing.
   - Develop the frontend using React.js, a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
   - Implement the user interface components, including the dashboard and visualization elements, using ECharts for data visualization.

4. **Sentiment Analysis Integration**
   - Utilize the Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API to perform sentiment analysis on the user reviews.
   - Integrate the sentiment analysis results into the backend APIs to categorize the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - Store the sentiment analysis results in a database or data structure for further analysis and visualization.

5. **Data Visualization Implementation**
   - Use ECharts to create interactive charts and graphs for visualizing the sentiment analysis results.
   - Implement the dashboard components to display metrics such as sentiment categorization, influential users, location analysis, demographics, popular devices/apps, and social media post types.
   - Ensure the visualizations are user-friendly, informative, and provide insights into user sentiments.

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Conduct thorough testing of the web application to ensure its functionality, performance, and accuracy.
   - Identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.
   - Perform quality assurance checks to ensure the application meets the defined requirements and provides accurate sentiment analysis and visualization.

7. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**
   - Document the project, including the architecture, design decisions, and implementation details.
   - Create user documentation to guide users on how to use the Rapid Analyzer web application.
   - Conduct knowledge sharing sessions within the team to share insights, learnings, and best practices.

8. **Final Testing, Bug Fixes, and Deployment**
   - Perform final testing to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.
   - Address any remaining bugs or issues identified during testing.
   - Prepare the application for deployment to a production environment, considering factors like scalability, security, and performance.
   - Deploy the Rapid Analyzer web application to a hosting platform or server for public or private access.

Note: Throughout the project, it's important to collaborate effectively as a team, regularly communicate progress, address challenges, and share knowledge and insights.
