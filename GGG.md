To create a sentiment analysis application for Google Play Store reviews and display the results on a website, you can use Python for the sentiment analysis and React.js for the web application. Here's a friendly guide to help you get started:

1. **Sentiment Analysis with Python**:
   - You can use Python for sentiment analysis by leveraging libraries such as NLTK, TextBlob, or VADER. These libraries provide pre-trained models for sentiment analysis, making it easier for beginners to get started.
   - You can also explore machine learning techniques using libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow if you want to build custom sentiment analysis models.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - You can obtain the Google Play Store reviews data from sources such as Kaggle, which provides datasets for sentiment analysis of Google Play Store reviews[1].
   - Alternatively, you can use web scraping techniques to extract the reviews directly from the Google Play Store using Python libraries like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Once you have the reviews data, you can preprocess it by removing stop words, tokenizing the text, and performing lemmatization to prepare it for sentiment analysis.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Apply the chosen sentiment analysis technique to the preprocessed data to determine the sentiment of each review (positive, negative, or neutral).

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - After analyzing the reviews, you can use Python libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visualizations of the sentiment distribution, such as bar charts or pie charts.

6. **Web Application with React.js**:
   - To display the sentiment analysis results on a website, you can use React.js to build a simple web application.
   - You can use tools like Axios to fetch the sentiment analysis results from your Python backend and display them on the website.

Here are some resources to help you get started:
- Kaggle: Sentiment Analysis of Google Play Store Data[1]
