## Report on Backend Development of Playstore Sentiment Analysis Project

### Introduction
The backend development of the Rapid Analyzer project using Flask has been successfully completed. The project aims to analyze the sentiment of user reviews on the Playstore using natural language processing techniques.

### Backend Development Overview
The backend development involved creating a REST API using Flask in Python to perform sentiment analysis. The NLTK library was utilized to classify the text into positive and negative sentiment. The API supports both GET and POST HTTP functions for analyzing the sentiment of user reviews.

### Methodology
The sentiment analysis was achieved by leveraging the NLTK library for natural language processing. The backend development focused on creating an efficient and scalable API to process and analyze user reviews from the Playstore.

### Next Steps
The next phase of the project will involve front-end development to create a user interface for interacting with the sentiment analysis API. The front-end development will enable users to input text for sentiment analysis and visualize the results.

### Conclusion
The completion of the backend development marks a significant milestone in the Playstore sentiment analysis project. The utilization of Flask and NLTK has laid a solid foundation for the implementation of the sentiment analysis API. The upcoming front-end development phase will further enhance the project's usability and accessibility.
